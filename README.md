# Beginner HTML Code

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I showcase all my beginner HTML code. This collection represents my early steps into the world of web development, highlighting my journey and growth in understanding the fundamentals of HTML.
Actually there's more web development done by me, but all the files got deleted because my computer crashed and I did'nt have any backup and also I was not introduced to git earlier.
BTW if you want to know, I am good at HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS (Also built applications and websites using those).

## Motivation

Although my primary focus is now on Python, AI, and Machine Learning as my career path, I believe it's important to showcase my foundational skills in HTML. Learning HTML was a crucial step in my journey as a developer, providing me with a solid base in web development concepts and enhancing my understanding of web technologies. This repository is a testament to my learning process and serves as a resource for anyone starting their journey in HTML.

## Contents

This repository contains a variety of beginner-level HTML code examples, each focusing on different aspects of HTML development. You'll find:
